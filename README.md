# Coursera-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
The repository for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project

This project is for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course final project. The goal of this project is to take a real-world raw dataset, and create a 'tidy' dataset from it. The raw data comes from a test to develop improved activity algorithms. The test collected data from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone attached to subjects that performed specific activities. This raw data must be cleaned and tidied before it can be used for analysis and subsequent algorithm development.

# Additional discussion of the purpose and details of the project come from the Coursera files:
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
